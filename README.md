# Google Season of Docs 2020
Season of Docs experience, sync up reports and more...


> This document is journal of all the activities that I have developed before, during and after the documentation development phase in GSoD 2020.


Last year on September 15th, Google published the list of accepted technical writers to participate in their 2020 Google Season of Docs program and, Learning Equality accepted [my project proposal](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants/project-kolibri-stephdix).
LE is an open-source organization that developed Kolibri, an offline educational technology offered in different educational contexts across the world.

## Community Bonding 

**WEEK 1 - August 16th - August 21st**

This week I received a series of emails from selected projects for this Google Season of Docs series and an email saying that I had been selected to work with the LE doc project.

In this first week, there was still uncertainty about what to do; however, my mentor scheduled an introductory video call to get to know her and the other project's mentor. In the call, we introduced ourselves and Radina (my mentor) explained that we should explore the community forums and Slack channels info and threads. 

As for task-specific for this week, I have:

- [x]  `[DONE]` Attend to video call to get to know mentors and get a briefing on what should be covered in the community bonding period.
- Recommendations from the meet up:
    - Main POCs: Radina / Laura

    - Browse, browse, browse!!! (Slack channels and TALK forums)

**NOTE**: We were supposed to meet up again on Friday but the AHM was canceled due to most of the team were on vacation.
